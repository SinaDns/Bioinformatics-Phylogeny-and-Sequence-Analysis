# Sequencing File Analysis

This project involves exploring sequencing data from NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA), specifically the dataset **SRR12506197**. The goal is to understand sequencing file formats, assess data quality, and extract meaningful biological information.

## Objectives
- Understand sequencing file structures (FASTQ, etc.).
- Analyze data quality using **FastQC**.
- Explore sequence orientation and other key characteristics.

## Tools Used
- **Entrez Direct**: NCBI command-line tools for database access.
- **SRA Toolkit**: For downloading and managing sequencing data.
- **FastQC**: For quality control analysis of high-throughput sequence data.

## Contents
- `Sequencing_File_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and results.
